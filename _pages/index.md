I am a Researcher at the Centre of Biomedical Cybernetics, Department of Systems and Control, at the University of Malta, and a recent graduate from Imperial College London. I obtained an M.Sc. in Signal Processing from Imperial College London in 2024, following a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with First Class Honours from the University of Malta.

My research focuses on applying signal and image processing along with machine learning, to medical image analysis and the development of human-computer interaction (HCI) system. I have worked on a 3D deep learning model for organ segmentation from abdominal CT scans, which earned multiple awards for Best Final Year Project. I also developed an intrinsically explainable deep learning model for lung nodule classification in CT scans, improving transparency to support decision-making by radiologists. Most recently, I have been working on Electrooculography (EOG) and Videooculography (VOG) based eye gaze tracking systems for HCI applications. This includes investigating illumination-induced changes in EOG signals and developing signal processing and machine learning techniques for compensation. This work focused on enhancing the robustness of EOG-based eye gaze tracking systems, and has led to conference publications, media coverage, and poster presentations.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting
