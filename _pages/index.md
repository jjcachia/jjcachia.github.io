I am a Researcher at the Centre of Biomedical Cybernetics, Department of Systems and Control, at the University of Malta, and a recent graduate from Imperial College London. I obtained an M.Sc. in Signal Processing from Imperial College London in 2024, following a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with First Class Honours from the University of Malta.

My research focuses on applying signal and image processing along with machine learning, to medical image analysis and the development of human-computer interaction (HCI) system. I have worked on a 3D deep learning model for organ segmentation from abdominal CT scans, which earned multiple awards for Best Final Year Project. I also developed an intrinsically explainable deep learning model for lung nodule classification in CT scans, improving transparency to support decision-making by radiologists. Most recently, I have been working on Electrooculography (EOG) and Videooculography (VOG) based eye gaze tracking systems for HCI applications. This includes investigating illumination-induced changes in EOG signals and developing signal processing and machine learning techniques for compensation. This work focused on enhancing the robustness of EOG-based eye gaze tracking systems, and has led to conference publications, media coverage, and poster presentations.

Research Interest
======
Applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Signal and Image Processing

With a background in computer engineering and a specialisation in signal processing, I bring a strong technical foundation to my machine learning projects, enabling the integration of signal and image processing techniques into more robust pipelines. While much of my research has focused on medical image analysis and HCI development, I am generally interested in multimedia processing and the ways in which information is digitised and processed across different application domains. Given this, I am open to applying my skill set to novel, impactful areas where signal, image, and machine learning techniques can be used meaningfully.
